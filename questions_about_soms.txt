1. If you have the same data, and the same hyperparameters, and the same number of nodes, same m x n matrix of nodes, will you get the same result each time? 
2. Once the nodes "clusters" are calculated, how do we interpret the relationship between nodes?
3. Can we use a neural network to trim our SOM nodes to identify those which are most mutually exclusive?
4. How do we identify SOM clusters which are unphysical?
5. How do we determine the frequency of particular clusters within reanalysis? - If we calculate clusters based on Z500, how do we place a particular day in a cluster? 
  Possible solution: reshape the 2d map to 1 dimension, and calculate the "c" term where c = argmin(|x - m|) where x is the day and m is the cluster.
